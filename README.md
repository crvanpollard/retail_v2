## Suburan Retail Districts (2021 update)
An update to the existing [https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/retail/] (Suburban Retail Districts web map) that will improve performance, update data and information, and streamline the user experience. We will be moving away from the existing Leaflet platform into a custom solution built with mapboxgl js and custom vector tiles.

## JS library dependencies
- mapbox-gl.js (v0.44.2)
- bootstarp (3.4)
- jquery (3.5.1)
- highcharts 
- numeral.js

## Geospatial Data dependencies
Retail District spatial data is loaded using static GeoJson files for points and polygon features
