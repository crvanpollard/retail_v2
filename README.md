## Suburan Retail Districts (2021 update)
An update to the existing [https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/retail/](Retail) web map
that will improve performance, update data and information, and streamline the user experience. We will be moving away from the existing Leaflet platform into a custom solution built with mapboxgl js and custom vector tiles.
